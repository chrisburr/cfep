## Abstract

Allow package binaries to be uploaded from builds in pull requests.

## Motivation

Sometimes it would be useful to access binaries built in pull requests. Reasons include:

* Testing GUI applications
* More easily testing the effects on a pull requests on downstream packages. For example, patches in llvm affecting builds of clang.
* Debugging non-obvious failures during the tests stage of the build

While it is always possible to build binaries locally it can difficult to set up (e.g. macOS/Windows) or time consuming people only have access to less powerful machines.

## Specification

Upon request, any binaries built in a PR will be uploaded to a file sharing service.
[Firefox Send](https://github.com/timvisee/ffsend) is proposed in this CFEP however this could change to an alternative service such as [https://transfer.sh/](https://transfer.sh/) or a self hosted equivalent such as [transfer.sh](https://github.com/dutchcoders/transfer.sh) or [0x0](https://github.com/mia-0/0x0).

This change will be implemented by modifying the scripts generated by `conda-smithy` to check for the existence of a file named `CF_UPLOAD_PR_BUILDS` in the recipe directory.
A similar approach will be used for `staged-recipes`.
Rerendering will not be required to enable this feature and the `CF_UPLOAD_PR_BUILDS` file will be automatically deleted whenever a feedstock is rerendered.
Binaries are uploaded regardless of if test stage of the build is successfully.
Any uploaded files will be short lived, 24 hours is suggested however the exact limit will depend on the functionality of the file sharing service.
After the file is uploaded the URL will be shown in the CI log alongside a secure hash to allow the file integrity to be verified.

## Rationale

While this feature is useful in some situations, most binaries will never be downloaded and as such should not be uploaded by default to avoid wasting resources.
Removing the `CF_UPLOAD_PR_BUILDS` file after each re-render minimises the chances that this feature will be left enabled.

Firefox Send is proposed for the initial service provider due to it being provided by a large and well-known organisation.

## Alternatives

The use of a dedicated channel would make it slightly easier to use the uploaded binaries however this proposal was rejected for the following reasons:

    * This would likely be hosted on anaconda.org increasing the costs incurred by Anaconda, Inc.
    * Uploading to a channel would require credentials to be shared with pull requests and would be almost impossible to do securely
    * Additional infrastructure would be required to automatically delete packages after a short period of time
    * Identical build hashes in different builds can not be uploaded without modification
    * Packages from different pull requests/feedstocks may interact, or would require a large number labels to isolate from each other

The additional complexity from installing a binary instead of providing a full channel can be managed by adding documentation to [https://conda-forge.org/docs](https://conda-forge.org/docs).
